Steps(Optimal):
1. Define an un-ordered map with key_type and value_type both as int.
2. Run a loop to traverse the entire array.
3. Compute how much more is needed to achieve the target based on the current index.
4. Check if the remaining value(i.e to meet the target) happens to be inside our hash-map.
5. If it exists in our map then, return the index of the value and our current index.
6. Else add our current num and its index to the hashmap.
