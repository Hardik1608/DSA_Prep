Steps:

1. Create a mapping to convert the entire matrix into a array of size m*n.
2. Row is equal to the index divided by the numRows (i.e its a multiple of row).
3. Col is equal to the remainder we get after dividing the index with numRows.
4. Use this to apply Binary Search.
5. Return true when we find target else return false


Time Complexity: O(log(m*n))
Space Complexity: O(1)
