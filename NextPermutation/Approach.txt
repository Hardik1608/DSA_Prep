Steps:

1. Scan from the right to find the first index dip where nums[dip] < nums[dip+1].
2. If no such index exists, reverse the whole array (itâ€™s the last permutation).
3. Otherwise, from the right, find the first element greater than nums[dip] and swap them.
4. Finally, reverse the subarray from dip+1 to the end.
