Steps:

1. Treat the array as a linked list where each index points to nums[index].
2. Use two pointers — slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps) — starting from index 0.
3. Move them until they meet inside the cycle (this confirms a duplicate exists).
4. Reset slow to the start (index 0) while keeping fast at the meeting point.
5. Move both one step at a time; the node where they meet is the duplicate number.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
