Steps:

1. Use two pointers (l and r) to represent a sliding window over the string.
2. Keep a hash/array to store the last index where each character appeared.
3. Move r forward to include a new character.
4. If the new character was seen inside the current window, move l forward to skip its last occurrence.
5. Update the window length r - l + 1 and track the maximum length so far.
6. Continue until r reaches the end of the string, then return the maximum length.
