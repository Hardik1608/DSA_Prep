Steps:

1. Start with two pointers, slow and fast, both at the head of the list.
2. Move slow one step and fast two steps at a time, until they either meet (cycle exists) or fast/fast->next becomes NULL (no cycle).
3. If a meeting point is found, reset slow back to the head.
4. Move both slow and fast one step at a time.
5. The node where they meet again is the start of the cycle.
