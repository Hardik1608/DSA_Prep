Steps:

1. Start with sum = 0 and maxSum as a very small number.
2. Go through each element in the array and keep adding it to sum.
3. Update maxSum whenever sum becomes larger than the current maxSum.
4. If sum becomes negative, reset it to 0 (because starting fresh is better).
5. After the loop, return maxSum as the maximum subarray sum.
