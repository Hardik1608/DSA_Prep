Steps:

1. Initialize left and right pointers at 0th index, cSum which tracks of total sum till current index and maxL which computes the maximum length.
2. Traverse through the array till right is within array and increment the cSum with current index.
3. Check whether cSum is greater than target and left is less than right.
4. Decrease the cSum by the value that left has and increment the left counter.
5. If cSum is equal to the target then update the maxL.
6. Return the maxL when loop ends.
