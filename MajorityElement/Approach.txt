Steps:

1. Initialize a variable el (candidate element) and a counter cnt = 0.
2. Traverse the array one element at a time.
3. If cnt == 0, set the current number as the new candidate el.
4. If the current number equals el, increment cnt; otherwise decrement cnt.
5. After finishing the traversal, el will be the majority element (if one exists).

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
