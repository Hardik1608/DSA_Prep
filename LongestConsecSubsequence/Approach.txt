Steps:

1. First create an unordered set and insert all the elements to it.
2. Now iterate through each of the element of this set.
3. Check if there exists some element in the set that comes just before our current element and if so then do nothing.
4. If there isn't any element which exists before our current element that means its the starting point of a subsequence.
5. Iterate through this element until there exits its next element.
6. Update the max length.
7. Return the final max length.
