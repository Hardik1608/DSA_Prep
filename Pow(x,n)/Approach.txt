Steps:

1. Check if n is non-negative, or else take the reciprocal of x and multiply n by -1.
2. Run a loop until the binaryForm is non-zero.
3. With each iteration, multiply x by itself and divide binaryForm by 2.
4. If the remainder of binaryForm when divided by 2 gives 1, multiply ans with x before updating x.

Time Complexity: O(logn)
