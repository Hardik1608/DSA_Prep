Steps:

1. Start three pointers: i at the end of the valid part of nums1, j at the end of nums2, and k at the end of nums1.
2. Compare nums1[i] and nums2[j].
3. Place the larger of the two at nums1[k], then move that pointer (i or j) and k backward.
4. Repeat until either i or j runs out.
5. If any elements remain in nums2, copy them to the front of nums1.

Time Complexity: O(m+n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
